# hello-world
Just another repository

hi, I'm Enrico from delicious Italy; I'm new here and wish to learn a batch of new concepts about programming and designing a website.
I've studied for three years kinesiology in my state and I'm going to be graduate in march but, until that date, I want to engage myself in other stimulating disciplines.
For now, it's all but wait for other upgrades that will be coming soon!
